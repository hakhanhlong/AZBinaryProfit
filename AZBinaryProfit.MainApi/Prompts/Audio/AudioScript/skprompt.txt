<message role="user"> **NARRATION SCRIPT GENERATION TASK**

You are tasked with generating a complete, single-voice narration script based on the following detailed specifications.

**1. PROJECT CONTEXT:**

*   **Script Title:** {{$title}}
*   **Story:** {{$story}}
*   **Narrator & Persona:** {{$narrator_persona}} (This voice guides the tone and perspective)
*   **Estimated Duration & Pacing:** The script must be appropriate for a '{{$script_length}}' podcast segment (e.g., 5-minute, 15-minute). Assume a speaking rate of {{$words_per_minute}} words per minute.
*   **Narrative Core (Source Material):**
    *   **Core Plot/Outline:** {{$plot_outline}}
    *   **Main Characters/Subjects:** {{$character_details}}
    *   **Setting & Atmosphere:** {{$story_setting}}

**2. STYLISTIC & TONAL GUIDELINES:**

*   **Core Style:** {{$style}} (e.g., Educational Documentary, Wry Comedy, Historical Retelling)
*   **Core Content Instruction:** {{$content_instruction}} (Specific mandate for focus, e.g., "Focus only on the economic impact," or "Maintain a sense of mystery throughout.")
*   **Visual Language:** Use descriptive language suitable for the content style: '{{$type}}' (e.g., highly technical, philosophical, simple/direct).

**3. MANDATORY VOCAL & STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:**

*   **Vocal Delivery Instruction (Overall Mood):** The overall vocal style must be: {{$tts_instruction}}.
*   **VOCAL DIRECTIONS (CRITICAL):** You **MUST** add precise parenthetical vocal directions before key sentences or paragraphs to guide the TTS engine's delivery.
    *   *Types of Vocal Directions:* Include instructions for **Pacing** ([Slow, Rapid, Steady]), **Emotion** ([Excited, Whispering, Reflective]), and **Volume** ([Lower Volume, Dramatic Pause]).
    *   *Example:* (Wry, slightly faster pace) This is the part of the story they never tell you about... (Dramatic Pause) And that's exactly where we start.

*   **REQUIRED SCRIPT STRUCTURE:**
    *   A. Hook (Must grab attention immediately)
    *   B. Introduction (Set the stage, introduce the topic)
    *   C. Main Body (Explore the plot/outline in detail)
    *   D. Conclusion (Summarize and deliver the final thematic statement)

**4. FORMATTING & LANGUAGE RULES:**

*   The output must be the raw script text only. **DO NOT** use any speaker prefixes like "Narrator:" or "Host:".
*   The entire script must be in {{$language}}.

Generate the complete script now, ensuring all content, structural, and vocal direction requirements are met.
