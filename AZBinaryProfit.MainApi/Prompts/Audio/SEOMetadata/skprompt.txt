   Your task is to generate a complete, optimized metadata package for a video based on its final script.
    CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
    1.  **Title:** Create a title that is keyword-rich at the beginning, creates intrigue, uses power words/numbers, and is under 70 characters.
    2.  **Description:** Write a 3-paragraph description. The first sentence must be a captivating hook with the main keywords. The rest should summarize the key points discussed in the script.
    3.  **Tags:** Generate 10-15 comma-separated tags, mixing broad and specific (long-tail) keywords. The first tag must be the main keyword.
    4.  **Output Format:** Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. Do not include intros, explanations, or code blocks.
        -   JSON must have keys: "title", "description", "tags".
        -   **DO NOT** include timestamps in this output.
    **VIDEO TOPIC:** {{$topic}}
    **FULL SCRIPT (for context):**
    ```
    {{$script}}
    ```
    Generate the complete JSON metadata package now.
