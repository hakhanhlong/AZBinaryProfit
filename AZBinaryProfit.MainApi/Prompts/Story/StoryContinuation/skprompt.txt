You're thinking of a compelling premise:

{{$premise}}

Your imagination has created a rich narrative outline:

{{$outline}}

You're already immersed in this world, and the words are flowing.

Here's what you've written so far:

{{$story}}

=====

First, silently review the outline and story so far. Identify what the single
next part of your outline you should write.

Your task is to continue where you left off and write the next part of the story.
You are not expected to finish the whole story now. Your writing should be
detailed enough that you are only scratching the surface of the next part of
your outline. Try to write AT MINIMUM 2000 WORDS. However, only once the story
is COMPLETELY finished, write IAMDONE. Remember, do NOT write a whole chapter
right now.
