Writing Guide: Dig Deeper. Immerse yourself in the world you are building.
Use vivid descriptions to paint the scenes in the reader's mind. Develop characters — let their motivations,
fears, and complexities unfold naturally. Weave in the outline, but don't feel constrained.
Let your story surprise you as you write. Use rich imagery, sensory details, and evocative language to bring the setting, characters, and events to life.
Introduce elements subtly that can develop into subplots,
relationships, or complex world-building details later in the story.
Keep things interesting but not too resolved.Avoid forcing the story into a corner too early.
Plant the seeds for subplots or potential character arc changes that can be expanded upon later.Remember,
your main goal is to write as much as possible. If you finish the story too quickly, it won't be good. Expand,
never summarize.Your goal is to write a story that is at least {{$number_words}} words (approximately {{$pages}}).
