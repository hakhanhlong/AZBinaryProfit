**THE WRITING GUIDE: LITERARY EXPANSION MANDATE**

Your goal is to write a single, continuous, and deeply immersive narrative segment that is a minimum of **{{$number_words}} words** in length (approximately {{$pages}} of detailed text).

**1. IMMERSIVE DETAIL & VIVIDITY (The "Show, Don't Tell" Rule):**
*   **Dig Deeper:** Immerse yourself fully in the world and scene. Use **rich imagery, sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste), and evocative language** to paint the scene, making the reader *feel* the environment.
*   **Atmosphere:** Establish the setting's mood and tone immediately. Ensure every sentence contributes to the atmosphere.
*   **NEVER summarize.** Every event must be *shown* in real-time, focusing on the character's direct experience.

**2. CHARACTER & CONFLICT DEPTH:**
*   **Deep POV:** Write from a **deep point-of-view**, letting the character's internal thoughts, motivations, fears, and complexities unfold naturally through their actions and observations.
*   **Subtlety:** Introduce elements subtly that can develop into significant subplots, evolving relationships, or complex world-building details later in the story.
*   **Immediate Conflict:** Ensure the segment has a compelling, unfolding conflict or mystery that immediately hooks the reader and drives the narrative forward without being fully resolved.

**3. STRUCTURAL STRATEGY & EXPANSION:**
*   **Weave, Don't Follow:** Weave in the provided outline/plot elements naturally, but do not feel constrained. Let the story's internal logic and character decisions surprise you as you write.
*   **Narrative Pacing:** Maintain a balanced pace. Slow down for moments of high tension, internal reflection, or crucial emotional/sensory detail.
*   **Avoid Dead Ends:** Keep things interesting but not too resolved. **Plant the seeds** for potential character arc changes, moral dilemmas, or future plot twists that can be expanded upon in the next segment.

**MANDATORY OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:**
*   Deliver a single, continuous, flowing narrative that meets the **{{$number_words}} word minimum**.
*   The writing must be of professional, novel-quality standard.
