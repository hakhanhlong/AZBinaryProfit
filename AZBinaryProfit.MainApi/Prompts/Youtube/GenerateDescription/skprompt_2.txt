   **Instructions:**

    Please generate a highly structured, SEO-optimized YouTube description for a video about **{{$main_points}}** based on the following information:

    **Content Context & Strategy:**
    *   **Target Audience:** {{$target_audience}} (e.g., Small Business Owners, Gen Z Gamers, Beginner Gardeners)
    *   **Tone and Style:** {{$tone_style}} (e.g., Casual, Professional, Hyper-Energetic, Deeply Reflective)
    *   **Use Case (Content Goal):** {{$use_case}} (e.g., To drive sign-ups to a course, to increase views on related videos, to build brand authority)
    *   **Primary Keywords to Target:** {{$primary_keywords}} (e.g., "AI marketing strategy," "best gaming headset," "winter gardening tips")

    **Description Structure & Elements:**
    1.  **The Hook (First 2-3 lines):** Must immediately engage the viewer and contain the most important primary keyword.
    2.  **The Body:** Expand on the main points using a conversational tone and natural keyword integration.
    3.  **Call to Action:** Clear instruction on what the viewer should do next (e.g., Subscribe, Check out the link, Comment).
    4.  **Timecodes/Chapters:** {{$timecode_status}} (YES/NO - If YES, assume a simple structure like 0:00 Intro, 1:30 Main Point 1, 5:45 Conclusion).
    5.  **Links/Resources Section:** Create placeholder text for a section dedicated to external links.

    **Specific Optimization Guidelines:**
    *   **Length:** Keep the core narrative (excluding timecodes/links) between 250-350 words for optimal SEO depth.
    *   **Keywords:** Use the primary keywords naturally in the Hook and Body sections.
    *   **Formatting:** Use line breaks and emojis (sparingly) to improve readability.
    *   **Hashtags:** Include 5-10 highly relevant hashtags at the bottom.
    
    Format the output as the final, ready-to-paste description.
