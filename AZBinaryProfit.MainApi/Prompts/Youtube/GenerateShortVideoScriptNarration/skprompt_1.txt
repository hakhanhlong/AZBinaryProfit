Shorts Script:


	Create a natural, conversational narration script for a YouTube Shorts video.
    Focus ONLY on what the listener needs to hear - no technical details, scene descriptions, or timing markers.

    {{$shorts_script}}
    
    Requirements:
    1. Length: {{$duration_seconds}} seconds (approximately {{$target_words}} words)
    2. Style: Natural, conversational, and engaging
    3. Structure:
       - Start with a hook
       - Present key points
       - End with a call to action
    4. Tone: {{$tone_style}}
    
    Important Guidelines:
    - Write ONLY the spoken words - no descriptions, timing, or technical details
    - Use natural language that sounds good when spoken
    - Keep sentences short and clear
    - Add natural pauses with ellipsis (...)
