**GENERATIVE IMAGE PROMPT FOR YOUTUBE THUMBNAIL**

Generate a single, high-resolution image designed specifically as a YouTube thumbnail. The final image must strictly adhere to the following professional specifications, focusing on maximum visual impact and Click-Through Rate (CTR).

**1. CORE CONCEPT & STYLE:**
*   **Concept Description:** {{$concept_description}} (The main action, subject, and emotional trigger.)
*   **Thumbnail Style:** {{$style_preference}} (e.g., Hyper-Realistic, Cinematic, Stylized Graphic, Abstract/Geometric.)
*   **Image Style/Quality:** {{$image_style}} (e.g., Photorealistic, Detailed Digital Painting, 3D Render, Film Grain/Vintage.)
*   **Aspect Ratio:** {{$aspect_ratio}} (e.g., 16:9, or 1:1 if a square social media crop is also needed.)

**2. VISUAL ELEMENTS & COMPOSITION:**
*   **Image Focus (The Main Subject):** {{$image_focus}} (Specify the subject, its action, and the desired emotional expression, e.g., "A shocked person screaming directly into the camera," "A golden object floating in a void.")
*   **Visual Hierarchy:** The main subject must be prominent, occupying the majority of the frame, with the background visually blurred or simple to ensure the subject **pops**.
*   **Lighting & Depth:** Use dramatic, high-contrast lighting (e.g., hard shadows, rim lighting) and shallow depth of field to make the subject stand out.
*   **Color Palette (Mandatory):** {{$color_palette}} (List the 2-3 main colors, e.g., "Neon Yellow, Deep Black, Crimson Red accents.")

**3. TEXT & READABILITY:**
*   **Text Content (Exact):** {{$text_content}} (The concise, high-impact text to overlay on the image.)
*   **Text Style:** {{$text_style}} (e.g., Bold, Blocky sans-serif, Hand-drawn/Grungy, Outline/Shadow effect.)
*   **Text Location & Visual Flow:** {{$text_location}} (Specify placement: e.g., "Large text angled from lower left to upper right," "Text contained within a colorful, distinct shape in the upper-right quadrant.")
*   **Readability:** The text must be large, high-contrast, and instantly readable even on the smallest mobile phone display.

**MANDATORY OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:**
The final image must be a single, visually striking, high-contrast, and mobile-optimized YouTube thumbnail that successfully integrates all the above elements.
